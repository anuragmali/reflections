When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - when more than one contributors are working on the file at the same time from different locations
  then it is easy to keep the repository at remote
  - it helps to keep the backup of your local repository on cloud and people from git hub community can
  view, suggest, contribute to your work which helps in overall developmet

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  - IF you want git to automatically stay up-to-date with remote then there can be certian unwanted changes introduced to your local directory. these chnages can be different commits to a branch or different branches itself.
  - pulling manually gives us freedom of pulling the required branch to our local directory
